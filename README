### How to launch?

- Setup env https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
- Run `npm run ios-hard`

### Some details & simplifications

1. React native navigation was chosen just to try it.
2. Image list state is global for the whole app. It doesn't support to be mounted multiple times.
3. Image viewer is very simple - just enough for not paid challenge app.
4. Objects passed between screens, not ids, and no normalization. It is not needed in the current case.
5. Outdated requests are not canceled after sending, but responses ignored.
